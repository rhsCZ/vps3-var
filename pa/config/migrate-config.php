/**
 * This script migrates the old configuration format to the new one.
 * It reads from inc/config.inc.php and creates a new config/settings.php file.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTES:
 * - This script should only be run from the command line for security reasons.
 * - The old configuration format is deprecated as of version 4.0.0 and will be
 *   completely removed in the next major release.
 * - Run this migration script to preserve your settings in the new format.
 * - After migration, you can still use both configuration formats in version 4.0.0,
 *   but we recommend using only the new format for future compatibility.
