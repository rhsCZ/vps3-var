## Installation

To install Poweradmin onto your system there are a few dependencies, they are listed below.

On Debian-based systems and their derivatives (with sudo or as root, Debian 12 or later recommended):
> **Note:** `php-fpm` is required only if you plan to use Nginx or choose not to use `mod_php` with Apache.

```sh
apt install php php-intl php-php-gettext php-tokenizer php-fpm

#For MySQL/MariaDB
apt install php-mysql

#For PostgreSQL
apt install php-pgsql

#For SQLite
apt install php-sqlite3
```

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and its derivatives:

```sh
dnf install -y php php-intl php-gettext php-pdo php-fpm

#For MySQL/MariaDB
dnf install -y php-mysqlnd

#For PostgreSQL
dnf install -y php-pgsql
```

To get Poweradmin working on your preferred webserver (Apache/NGINX for example), download the source-code from GitHub.
Note that Ubuntu has an Apache server by default, so the following NGINX configuration is only needed for Debian or
custom installations:

* Via Git:
    * Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin.git```
    * Change directory to the cloned repository: ```cd poweradmin```
    * Select the latest stable tag (for example v3.8.1): ```git checkout tags/v3.8.1```
    * Alternatively, you can use the master branch, but it might be unstable as it is used for development:
      ```git checkout master```
* Via releases:
    * Get the latest file from [releases](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/releases)

For NGINX create a configuration file that looks like this (done on Debian), of course adjust values to your liking:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    root /var/www/html;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }

    # Deny access to .htaccess and .htpasswd files for security reasons
    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }
}
```
With the above NGINX configuration, make sure to also move all the files in the Poweradmin (repository) directory to the root declared in the configuration (in the example: `root /var/www/html;`). Once this is done, reload your NGINX installation and it should be applied.
Then you can navigate to the installed system in your browser

> **Note:** You can also safely remove the default index.html (or derivative).

* Visit http(s)://HOSTNAME/install/ and follow the installation steps.
* Once the installation is complete, remove the `install` folder.
* Point your browser to: http(s)://URL
* Log in using the default 'admin' username and the password created during setup (provided in step 3).

### Debug Settings

To help diagnose issues, you can enable various debug settings in the `inc/config.inc.php` file. Below are the available
debug settings and how to enable them:

1. **PHP Error Reporting**: To display PHP errors directly in the browser, add the following lines to your `index.php`
   or any other entry point file:
    ```php
    ini_set('display_errors', 1);
    ini_set('display_startup_errors', 1);
    error_reporting(E_ALL);
    ```

2. **Logger Settings**: Configure the logging settings to use the native type and debug level. Currently, these settings
   are used only for logging authentication issues:
    ```php
    $logger_type = 'native';
    $logger_level = 'debug';
    ```

3. **Database Debugging**: Enable or disable database debugging. When enabled, detailed database operations and errors
   will be logged:
    ```php
    $db_debug = true;
    ```

4. **DNSSEC Debugging**: Enable or disable DNSSEC debugging. When enabled, detailed DNSSEC operations and errors will be
   logged:
    ```php
    $pdnssec_debug = true;
    ```

5. **LDAP Debugging**: Enable or disable LDAP debugging. When enabled, detailed LDAP operations and errors will be
   logged:
    ```php
    $ldap_debug = true;
    ```

By enabling these settings, you can gain more insight into the application's behavior and troubleshoot issues more
effectively.
